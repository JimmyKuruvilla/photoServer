- install postfix to get crontab logs, install mutt for better mail handling

- use pm2 to manage the js service
- use restart:always in the docker-compose.yml to have the pg container restart
- relies on systemd to ensure db first, then pm2 service. No guarantee the connection will be available - fix later
