- use pm2 to manage the js service
- use restart:always in the docker-compose.yml to have the pg container restart
- relies on systemd to ensure db first, then pm2 service. See pm2.service.manualAddon

TODO
leave original service alone and build a new one along side it. 
0. refactor utils + guards
store a hash of a file on injest. So we can tell which files are the same.
3. videos need a thumbnail as well. 
- take first frame or 2seconds in. 

1. use express 5
// refactor listings

3. convert to react + vite

1. implement permadelete
 - add delete button to files with conf. maybe after react. 

2. maybe add a query for num faces detected once react is ready
and a button to rerun face detection on the current file - !

store the type of video or picture in the db so that the select random can use it to pick. 

refacotr db into "mdoels"
