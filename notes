- use pm2 to manage the js service
- use restart:always in the docker-compose.yml to have the pg container restart
- relies on systemd to ensure db first, then pm2 service. See pm2.service.manualAddon

TODO
leave original service alone and build a new one along side it. 
1. use express 5
2. simplify routing as much as possible
// refactor listings

3. convert to react + vite

1. implement permadelete
 - add delete button to files with conf. maybe after react. 

2. maybe add a query for num faces detected once react is ready
and a button to rerun face detection on the current file - !

3. videos need a thumbnail as well. 
- take first frame or 2seconds in. 

fix print
store a hash of a file on injest. So we can tell which files are the same.
